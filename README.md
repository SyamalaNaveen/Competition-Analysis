# Competition-Analysis
In the navigation bar there are:
1. OverView
2. Compare top routes
3. Realtime Search
4. Map Operators
5. Normalize Operators
6. Routes Data
* We have to enter source, destination and date in the specified field it will show the bus operators that are available on that time.
* If we click on compare top routes in menu bar/ navigation bar, It will compare top routes with other bus operator website which are available on that date. And compare top routes are defined in the html code because most of the people will travel to those destinations more frequently.
* There are some operators which are not in included in top routes so, I have included live route map in the menu bar. Which shows live routes that are available on that date.
* Map operator is used to map operator that are available on abhibus website or redbus website which will be updated in database.
* Update operator is used to update the id based on the bus operator that are available in abhibus and redbus. 
* In Routes data it will display the source, destination and date have been entered.
* Overview will display the status of abhibus website operators and redbus website operators, and I have used comments for easy understanding.
